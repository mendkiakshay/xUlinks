Deep linking of web documents available over internet is a very old naive approach to make certain webpages or documents instantly available to its user. Over recent years the use of mobile deep linking (applinks) has surged. Deep linking, however is a victim to various attacks such as link-hijacking and phishing. Over the years of rapid development changes in technology and way of use of applinks are open to vulneribilities. Our work in this project presents a practical solution to restrict this problem. We also present in our work the problem of 'Over-permissibility' in Android.
